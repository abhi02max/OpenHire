OpenHire

OpenHire is an open-source freelancing platform designed to connect freelancers (developers), recruiters, and project providers through open-source contributions. By enabling developers to showcase skills via real coding projects, OpenHire eliminates reliance on resumes, empowering novice freelancers to build portfolios and helping recruiters evaluate talent transparently. Project providers can post tasks and select developers based on demonstrated expertise, fostering a skill-based hiring ecosystem.
Developed by a team of four students‚Äîled by Abhideep‚Äîas part of a Design Thinking project at Vallurupalli Nageswara Rao Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology, OpenHire aims to make freelancing accessible and equitable. We‚Äôre excited to develop features like GitHub Integration for real-time contribution tracking and welcome community contributions! üöÄ
